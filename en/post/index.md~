Given a ground set of items, result diversification aims to select a
subset with high \`\`quality" and \`\`diversity" while satisfying some
constraints. It arises in various real-world applications, such as
web-based search, document summarization, feature selection and
facility location, just to name a few. The quality can often be
characterized by a monotone submodular function, and the diversity is
usually measured by the sum of distances between the selected
items. In this talk, we will introduce how to apply multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) to solve the result diversification
problem. We will show that MOEAs can achieve the (asymptotically)
optimal polynomial-time approximation ratio for the problem with
cardinality constraints as well as the more general matroid
constraints. Furthermore, we will show that when the quality or
distance changes dynamically, MOEAs can maintain the optimal
approximation ratio in polynomial running time, which addresses the
open question proposed by [Borodin et al. TALG'17].
