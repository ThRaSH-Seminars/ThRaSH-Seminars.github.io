<h2 id="about">About ThRaSH</h2>
        <p>Randomized search heuristics such as stochastic gradient methods, simulated annealing, evolutionary algorithms, stochastic neural networks for optimization, ant colony and swarm optimization, and the cross-entropy method are frequently used across many scientific communities. They have been successfully applied in various domains, both for combinatorial and numerical optimization. Despite their success in practice, proving that such algorithms satisfy certain performance guarantees is still a difficult and widely open problem.</p>
        <p>The mission of the theory of randomized search heuristics (ThRaSH) seminar series is to contribute to the theoretical understanding of randomized search heuristics, in particular of their computational complexity. The aim is to stimulate interactions within the research field and between people from different disciplines working on randomized algorithms. The primary focus is on discussing recent ideas and detecting challenging topics for future work, rather than on the presentation of final results.</p>

                    Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged as a predominant approach for addressing multi-objective optimization problems. However, the theoretical foundation of 
                    multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), particularly the fundamental aspects like running time analysis, remains largely underexplored. Existing theoretical studies mainly 
                    focus on basic MOEAs, with little attention given to practical MOEAs. Recently, researchers have begun to examine practical MOEAs, 
                    e.g., NSGA-II/III, MOEA/D, and SMS-EMOA. However, the running time analysis of Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2), one of the most popular MOEAs, has not been touched.

                <p>
                    In this talk, we will present the first theoretical analysis of the running time for SPEA2 on three commonly studied multi-objective optimization problems: m-OneMinMax, m-LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes, 
                    and m-OneJumpZeroJump. We show that SPEA2 achieves expected running times of O(µn min{mlog(n)}, O(µn<sup>2</sup>), and O(µn<sup>k</sup>min{mn,3<sup>m/2</sup>}) for these 
                    problems respectively, where m is the number of objectives, and µ is the population size. The proofs are accomplished through general theorems which are also applicable for analyzing the expected 
                    running time of other MOEAs on these problems, and thus can be helpful for future theoretical analysis of MOEAs.

                    A hidden subset is defined on n bits, embedded in N bits (where N is typically much larger than n). The remaining N-n bits are neutral and do not affect the fitness of a string. There exist
                    evolutionary algorithms which find an optimal string in time that depends only on n and not on N for certain hidden subset problems. However, there seems to be no way for the algorithm to know 
                    when it has found the solution, nor can the relevant bits be identified once it has done so. We address this problem by running log(N) copies of the algorithm in parallel and taking a vote for 
                    the value in each bit position. Along the way, we prove a couple of lemmas of potentially broad application. The first gives an easy way of obtaining a bound on the time taken for a number of 
                    parallel runs of a process to complete. The second states that the probability a (1+1)EA, with any mutation scheme, produces an incorrect bit value, for weakly monotonic functions with a unique
                    optimum, is no greater than 1/2, at each time step.
